    <b>About half girlfriend</b>
                Half Girlfriend is very cleverly marketed as a story of Madhav, a Hindi speaking Bihari who falls in love with Riya, an elite 
                Delhi girl at the prestigious St. Stephen’s College. It deceives you into believing that the story would revolve around the 
                travails of a person who cannot speak English. Madhav is heartbroken, and after completing his graduation he ditches his 
                high-paying corporate offer and moves back to his village Dumraon, helping his mother with running the village school. 
                Now running a school requires funds, and his mother, the Rani Sahiba of Dumraon, has been paying out everything off her 
                own pocket to support and run it as politics and political leaders have stashed in all the government funds. Gates Foundation
                visiting India, and now the political leaders turn to better the school in order to better their own image. Madhav latches
                on to this opportunity, but there’s a catch – he has to deliver a speech in English to the world’s richest man to secure the 
                funds. St. Stephens hadn’t bettered Madhav’s English, and to brush it up for the speech, he decides to visit Patna, where he 
                has a chance encounter with Riya, and their friendship blossoms once again. Riya helps Madhav with his English, and 
                disappears after he delivers the speech and secures the grant for his school, leaving behind a letter in which she reveals that 
                she has cancer and just has three more months of life left in her.

<b>About The 3 Mistake Of My Life</b>
                In late-2000, a young boy in Ahmedabad called Govind dreamt of having a business. To accomodate his friends Ish and 
                Omi’s passion, they open a cricket shop. Govind wants to make money and thinks big. Ish is all about nurturing Ali, the 
                batsman with a rare gift. Omi knows his limited capabiltiies and just wants to be with his friends. However, nothing 
                comes easy in a turbulent city. To realize their goals, they will have to face it all – religious politics, earthquakes, riots,
                unacceptable love  and above all,  their own mistakes. Will they make it? Can an individual’s dreams overcome the 
                nightmares offered by real life? Can we succeed despite a few mistakes. Enter Omi’s Bitoo mama (maternal uncle), 
                a communal party man bent on converting the young into fighters in the name of Hinduism. Situations come to a head 
                and Ahmedabad burns in riot fires. Omi dies saving Ali and Ishan finds out about Vidya and Govind, a 
                betrayal he does not forgive. These events lead Govind to his death-bed and that is when he writes the email to Bhagat.
